Riddles for the Brainy

1. I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?
2. I'm not alive, but I can grow. I don't have lungs, but I need air. What am I?
3. The more you take, the more you leave behind. What am I?
4. I'm always hungry, I must always be fed. The finger I touch, will soon turn red. What am I?
5. I am taken from a mine and shut up in a wooden case, from which I am never released, and yet I am used by almost every person. What am I?
